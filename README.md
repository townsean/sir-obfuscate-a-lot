# sir-obfuscate-a-lot
A web app that obfuscates words

## Synopsis
Sir Obfuscate-a-Lot is a simple website that will take a word or words and display scrambled versions of the given words. 

For ultimate cheese factor, Ashley created a small parody of [Sir Mix-a-Lot's Baby Got Back song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X53ZSxkQ3Ho) for Sir Obfuscate-a-Lot's home page:

*I like scrambled words, and I cannot lie  
You other logophiles can't deny  
That when a word you know has it's letters in row  
But they're all not in their place  
You get hung*

A **logophile** is a person who loves words.
